# Virginia Valium
## Bio

I was born in Moon, Virginia, at the age of 8. Since then I've wandered around, gazing melancholically at the horizon and/or skipping happily on the green grass.

My love for the universe takes many forms, but digitally it usually makes itself visible/audible/interactable through visual art, music and videogames. I write too, though I don't share it much with anyone other than my future selves.

This might come as kinda cold, because I am having that kind of day today: I am a bit tired, overwhelmed and saturated with stimuli and my period is due soon, so my emotional state is somewhat cloudy.

I will probably continue this description soon.

In case I don't, I wish you a lovely web surf session <3


Love,

- V.
